# The Data Science Lifecycle Process

The Data Science Lifecycle Process is an end-to-end process for teams to collaborate on data science problems. Through our own experience working across many data science teams, we found that there was a lack of clear processes and workflows that enable teams to move from idea inception to pushing to production.

There is a large body of work about the Software Development Lifecycle, which has enabled faster and more reliable release cycles for application development. The Data Science Lifcycle Process seeks to fill this role for the Data Science community.

This repo is for documenting the approach and how to apply it to your own problems.
